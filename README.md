# Tomato-Plant-Disease-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Agriculture is vital to the economy, and tomato is a crop prone to diseases that reduce yield and quality. This project develops an automated tomato leaf disease detection system using machine learning to process images and classify Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, bacterial and viral disease.
